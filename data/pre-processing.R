# WARNING 2021-11-09 ---------
# There are currently problems with this script.
# The output created by the joining of the `parks` and `osm` objects only creates 19 observations of 3 variables.
# This is not the expected output when looking at the current parks.csv file (32 obs. of 19 variables), with observations based on facilities etc.
# I suspect that the final version of this pre-processing.R script that produced the output in the current format did not get committed to GitHub.
# For reproducibility this script needs amending to create the desired output, however at the time of writing some of the source information on the council website is also outdated.
# As a temporary measure amendments are being made directly to parks.csv
